# AuthApp 

AuthApp is a simple example of a login view built in the MVVP architecture that checks against a json user list if the user's 
credentials exist and are valid.

The app also has a simple Field Validator to check out that fields aren't empty and that they have a length of 2 or more 
characters, it can be easily expanded to include more complex validations if required.

To use it just clone and build, there are no additional dependencies required. 

AuthApp was built using Xcode 11.3.1 and swift 5
